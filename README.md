# Git basics
This repository is for practicing github work flow
Am learning about a pull request github workflow - and this is the first edit which am going to commit
A pull request :it is a proposal to other coders to review your code and pull it to merge it with the main branch if it is okay.
It allows for comparison before merge
Merge request merges the branch to main after approval if approval is necessary
